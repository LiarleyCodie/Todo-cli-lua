After more than 10 hours doing a super overview of this wonderful language that is __Lua__
I decided to create a simple project to put into practice and consolidate much of everything I saw,
I tried it and (supposedly) learned.

Using this project is counterintuitive as there is still no CLI to control what
This mini-project does, however, the entire base is already done.

All tasks are saved locally within a `.json` file.
When asking to list tasks, the method that reads this json is executed and when creating a new task
the method that saves is called.

it's possible:
- Create a task
- Delete a task
- Clear the task list
- Mark a task as completed or not completed
- List all tasks
- List a single task
